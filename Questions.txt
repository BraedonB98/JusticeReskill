On Multi-Class project linked tree part 2 , assignment 1, step 3 it says a secret answer, which will not be
displayed to the user. what does it mean by this and how do you not have it on the page without the user being able to
see it?

When a form is submitted, where do the answers/submissions go? Do we have to write the HTML code to save/do something with
submitted answers?

Can you have an id that is the same if they are like a button and an input box?
